# Predicting Startup Success

This repository contains code I wrote to predict the likelihood that an entrepreneur will be successful. So far, I have spent much of my time looking into features like:
    1. Number of previously founded organizations
    2. Number of exits
    3. Gender
    4. Category of startup
    5. Location of headquarters
and more. 

The models I have experimented with so far include KNN, Random Forest, Decisiion Tree, Logistic Regression, and KNN. I am working with a dataset of ~19,000 rows.
